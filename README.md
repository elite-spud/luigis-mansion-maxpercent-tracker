# Luigi's Mansion Max% Tracker
**Browser-based tracker to assist with Luigi's Mansion Max% speedruns**

Note that this does not show all money locations, only RNG money locations are shown.

The Kitchen, Tea Room and 2F Hallway mice are not shown, as you wouldn't progress in a run until you got them anyway.

By default, the tracker will switch between available, collected, and possibly collected money locations - if you wish to change this
behavior you will need to modify the variables in Settings.js located in the scripts folder. All the instructions
how to change it will be located there.
